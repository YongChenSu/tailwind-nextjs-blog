一位以交付為導向的前端工程師，擁有超過 4.5 年的開發經驗，專精於 Next.js、React 與 TypeScript，擅長清晰溝通與團隊合作，並致力於打造高品質、以使用者為核心的應用程式。

喜歡學習、分享，記錄程式技術進步的過程，興趣是登山、抱石，期許程式能力像山階或抱石級數一樣，一階一階往上攀升


A delivery-driven frontend engineer with over 4.5 years of development experience, specializing in Next.js, React, and TypeScript. Skilled in clear communication and collaboration, and dedicated to building high-quality, user-centric applications.

I enjoy learning and sharing, documenting the journey of progress in programming technology. My interests include mountaineering and bouldering. I aspire for my programming abilities to advance step by step, like climbing mountain grades or bouldering levels, ascending one level at a time.
