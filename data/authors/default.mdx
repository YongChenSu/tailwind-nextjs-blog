I am a senior front-end developer with over 4 years of experience and strong communication skills.

I specialize in React and Next.js, and have hands-on experience with TypeScript, performance optimization, and Cypress for E2E testing.

I'm also an active contributor to the open-source project GoodJob (https://github.com/goodjoblife/GoodJobShare), which promotes workplace transparency.
